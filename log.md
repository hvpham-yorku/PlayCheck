# Meeting Minutes 

### **Date: Jan 21st - Time: 8:22 pm**  

Spare Lab Time/Drop-In Hours 
- Time that is not spent working on the lab will be used as drop-in hours
- Drop-In hours will be used to touch base and basically have some work time alongside other team members 
- Not mandatory, but encouraged to so we can understand how actively everyone is working and helping each other with whatever is necessary
  
Topic Alteration
- After warnings from the TA and the Prof of the difficulty of having automatic detection utilizing object tracking, we are looking into just widening the scope of the project
- Intramurals companion app with a player side and a referee side.
Referee Side
- This will include a more manual version of the VAR-style idea we had. Whether or not object tracking will be implemented will be worried about later
- Stat tracking, calls and other things to aid referees will be featured
Player Side
- Mostly data driven things like stats or game history
- It was mentioned that we could do a still sports-focused database thing if the previously mentioned changes to our idea is shot down in the approval process
Prof Approval 
- Everyone present agreed with the changes. The final thing we are worried about is just getting approval. If not, then we can see what we can change about the pivot and look into

# Project Developments 
While originally starting off as just a VAR Detection System, we were quickly finding out that the difficulty of achieving that within the confines of the course would be much more complex than expected. During one of the meetings we agreed on a pivot towards a more robust, all-around companion app for community sports. This would be an app for intramurals/community sports that bridges the referees, players and organizers all into one system. <br/>
